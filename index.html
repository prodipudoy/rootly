          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Everyone knows incident management is hard. Dealing with a complicated service when it’s gone
            down is like being stuck in a collapsed mineshaft: everyone’s screaming in the dark, no-one knows
            what’s really going on. Cue frantic digging, trying to restore service as quickly as possible.
            After a few of these accidents, it’s natural to start to wonder if doing incident management
            really has to involve so much darkness and screaming.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid">

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="c_head">
          <p>What happens next often depends on who’s responsible for incident management in the org, and
            what their background is. If they’ve got a PM background, for example, they might start looking at
            improving their incident processes, figuring that the difficulties really stem from the chaos of trying
            to run an incident call. They might pick up a copy of the SRE book(s), or start looking at incident
            management protocols used by firefighters, or institute professionalised rotations which were
            previously done by a combination of luck and “everybody knows only Chris can fix this.”
            (Someone should make sure to tell Chris.)</p>
          <br>
          <p>If they’ve got a DevOps or an SRE background on the other hand, they might instinctually turn
            to software to fix their problems. Of course, software could be used in a thousand ways to help
            incident management. Today we see everything from home directory scripts that grep through
            a bunch of awkwardly placed log files, to sophisticated ML models looking for unknown patterns
            across terabytes of data. For incident management, though, most people end up looking for
            software support in actually conducting an incident.</p><br>
          <p>This context is a little unusual: not only is it something that has to do the usual data capture,
            transformation, storage, and transmission as every other online system, it’s also a system that has
            to be super reliable. If the system you’re using to help fix the broken things is itself broken, that’s just
            a surefire recipe for more darkness and screaming. It’s also vitally important for it not to get in the way:
            IM software should speed things up, not enmesh one in a web of box-ticking bureaucracy.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Though the requirements are a little unusual for normal online software, one of the main decisions
            you need to make is extremely traditional: that is, build-versus-buy.</p>

            <p>Build-versus-buy is a question lots of companies
              ask themselves all the time, and the set of things
              you have to think about is pretty well understood.
              Let’s look at the main concerns now.</p>

          <h3>Is this my core business?</h3>
          <p>As with most things in the world of software, it could be quite complicated, and there’s a large amount
            of detail to understanding it fully, but the basics are fairly straightforward. Basically, going with
            a commercial SaaS provider gives you bounded but guaranteed recurring costs, and going in-house
            gives you the opposite. To be clear, it might well be cheaper in-house - particularly if the developer
            salaries are being paid in some other way - but it might also be potentially a lot more expensive,
            particularly for maintenance.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, maintaining a non-core system is
              always going to be a headache; for example,
              if an engineer paid $250k a year spends 3
              months to build it and 25% of their time on
              maintaining it, that’s $62.5k, without adding
              product, project, or other management costs,
              never mind the unanticipated surprises that
              never happen in software development

        <div class="c_head">
          <h3>What are the risks?</h3>
          <p>In general the risks when you build in-house are around a lack of execution, which we often find
            or non-core systems. (This is especially risky if the IM developer(s) go away at short notice.) The risks
            when you outsource are typically either a product misfit, or business continuity risks on the provider side.
            That is, the provider could run out of money, have a significant technical problem, get sued out of
            existence, etc. For a product misfit, of course much less existential, the product might not end up doing
            the things you want, or the provider might take the tool in a direction you don’t agree with.</p>

          <p>A full accounting for all these risks is tricky, but ultimately you are balancing the (assumed) increased
            control you have over things in your local scope, versus external risks in the SaaS provider, coupled with
            by their obvious motivation to make their core product a success. </p>
          <p>Answer: <a href="#">could go either way,</a> <a href="#">depending very
              much on the client situation,</a> <a href="#">though for the small
              company for whom IM systems are non-core,</a> <a href="#">outsourcing probably edges it.</a>

            <h3>What is the reliability of in-versus out-sourcing?</h3>
            <p>Here is one concern which is probably weighted strongly towards out-sourcing. Having the incident
              management software running on systems which themselves are potentially taken out by the incident
              is a very serious problem. As against that, you balance the risk that the Internet will be inaccessible
              locally, or that the external provider will be inaccessible for potentially other reasons.</p>

          <p>But given how widely accessible Internet connectivity is these days, and how rarely well-hosted services go
            down, we would expect it is substantially less risky to use an out-sourced provider.</p>
          <p>Answer: <a href="#">almost certainly externally
              out-sourced,</a> <a href="#">unless you’re actually
              a cloud provider yourself.</a>

            <p>The argument that you are too busy to change away from your internal system, though you know
              it has problems, and that this is “okay for now” is correct only if you never encounter an incident
              which your internal system can’t handle. Our experience leads us to believe eventually, all
              organizations will encounter this. Ironically, this will happen sooner to the successful ones,
              since they’ll often scale very quickly as their customer base grows, and scaling very quickly
              is unfortunately strongly associated with incidents!</p>
            <p>If this is right, then the question becomes not whether to switch over, but when to switch over.
              The wrong moment to switch is of course, just after the big incident you didn’t handle correctly
              (but it is sadly a really common moment for companies to realise they had probably better do that
              thing they were putting off for ages - that is reality). The right moment is probably some function
              of how rapidly you’re scaling, how rapidly you believe you’ll scale in the future, and a complicated
              assessment of where you would otherwise put your effort, product roadmap, staff capability, and
              so on. As a rule of thumb, think that somewhere between a 2x and a 10x scaling usually provides
              a company with new problems that their previous ways of doing things don’t accommodate.
              If you find yourself on the bottom of one of those inflections, but clearly going in the “up and to
              the right” direction, consider strongly switching before get to the top of that hill, because chances
              are you’ll have lost something along the way.</p>
            <p>However, if you feel you’re not growing rapidly enough and have the effort to keep things ticking
              over in hand, we certainly won’t try to persuade you otherwise. There is an argument from the cost
              perspective too, of course - in order to evaluate that, you’d have to start putting numbers on what
              the existing system/approach is actually costing you. This can be tricky, particularly because
              intangibles like staff morale should also go in the equation! In general though, our recommendation
              would be that rising growth numbers, rising incident numbers, or decreasing staff morale would all
              be strong signals to move to professionalising your IM situation. </p>

            <p>Answer: <a href="#">Keep in-house until the numbers are going in the wrong direction.</a></p>
